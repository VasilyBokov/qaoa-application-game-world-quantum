Our lecture is ready to use pdf Guide for understanding the QAOA concept via game. You can find this Guide on our PDF file. Dominated set problem and N-Queens puzzle were considered. The first is suggested for exercise to play with the simplest QAOA Model. The second one is presented as an advanced concept for the classic QUBO proble (NP-complete) - N-queens puzzle problem and demostrated a correct solution for the four queens puzzle problem. This is the lecutural material for those postgraudate students who want to develop their quantum computational skills especially for solving optimization problems.
